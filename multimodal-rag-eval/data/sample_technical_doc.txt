System Integration Overview

The Redwire Space payload processing unit integrates with the Western Union payment gateway via secure REST API. Data flows through encrypted channels using TLS 1.3.

Key integration points:
- Payment validation: 99.9% uptime SLA
- Transaction latency: < 200ms p95
- Compliance: PCI-DSS Level 1
- Audit logging: 7-year retention

Architecture Diagram Description: The system consists of three tiers:
1. Presentation Layer - Streamlit dashboard for evaluation metrics
2. Service Layer - FastAPI RAG-as-a-Service with hybrid search
3. Data Layer - ChromaDB (vector) + BM25 (keyword) indexes

RAG Evaluation Metrics (Ragas):
- Faithfulness: Measures hallucination rate (0-1, higher = less hallucination)
- Answer Relevancy: Measures how well the answer addresses the question (0-1)

Hybrid Search combines:
- Vector search (semantic similarity via embeddings)
- BM25 search (keyword matching for technical terms)
